## Python Code

# Function to get chatbot response
def chatbot_response(user_input):
    user_input = user_input.lower()

    # Greetings
    if user_input in ["hello", "hi", "hey", "hola", "greetings"]:
        return "Hello! How can I help you today?"
    
    # Asking about bot
    elif user_input in ["how are you", "how are you?", "how's it going"]:
        return "I'm doing well, thanks for asking! How about you?"
    
    # User response to bot's mood
    elif user_input in ["i'm fine", "i am fine", "good", "great", "awesome"]:
        return "That's wonderful to hear!"
    elif user_input in ["not good", "bad", "sad", "tired"]:
        return "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Hope things get better soon!"

    # Fun responses
    elif user_input in ["tell me a joke", "joke", "make me laugh"]:
        return "Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it caught a virus! ðŸ˜„"
    
    # About bot
    elif user_input in ["what is your name", "who are you"]:
        return "I am ChatBot, your friendly assistant!"

    elif user_input in ["what can you do", "help", "assist me"]:
        return "I can chat with you, tell jokes, and answer simple questions!"
    
    # Farewell
    elif user_input in ["bye", "goodbye", "see you", "exit", "quit"]:

        return "Sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you try saying it differently?"

# Main chat loop
def chat():
    print("Welcome to the Extended ChatBot! (Type 'bye' to exit)")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")  # Get user input
        response = chatbot_response(user_input)
        print("Bot:", response)
        
        if user_input.lower() in ["bye", "goodbye", "exit", "quit"]:
            break
